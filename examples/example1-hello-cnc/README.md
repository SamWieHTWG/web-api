# Example 1: Hello CNC

## Description

A minimal example demonstrating the use of the CNC library.

This example is stripped down to the essentials required to start up the CNC and invoke CNC tasks.

To send commands to the CNC, a simple demo CLI menu is initiated.

## Features

- Utilizes internal simulation axes for drives.
- Scheduling is managed externally through direct invocation of the CNC tasks.

## Run and Debug

For instructions on how to run and debug, please see the [Run and Debug section](../README.md#run-and-debug) in the main README file.
